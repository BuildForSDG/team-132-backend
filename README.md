TEAM-132 GOORGANIC
## About

goOrganic is a platform platform that we have built to enable farmers to get the best practice farming methods information in an easy and efficient way, this can be achieved by relaying farming information through USSD by just dialing a shortcode. The information offers farmers with training involving organic farming methods. Farmers will also be able to partner with insurance companies to provide insurance cover for their products at affordable prices. goOrganic also provides a platform for farmers to post their products hence linking them to buyers

This project uses:

npm or yarn as dependency manager
Eslint: for linting
prettier: for formating code
Jest: for running tests

## Why

Most developing countries dependent on agriculture as the main source of revenue. This platform will enable farmers especially young people to utilize the opportunities that come with farming. Rate of food production will increase tremendously. Zero hunger goals is therefore achieved in developing countries

## Usage

How would someone use what you have built, include URLs to the deployed app, service e.t.c when you have it setup

## Setup

You should have nodejs and git installed.

1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/BuildForSDG/team-132-backend.git
2. Change into repo directory
cd team-214-backend

#### Hints

- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` 
- Run tests: `npm run test`
- Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `npm run lint`
- Run your app in local dev mode: `npm run dev`. This puts the bundled app in a `dist` folder, set up a local web server at localhost:8000, and continues to watch for your code changes which it syncs with the local server. This means if you loaded the app in a browser, it will auto-refresh as you code along. Feel free to use whatever bundler best meets your needs.

## Contributing

If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :

1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
